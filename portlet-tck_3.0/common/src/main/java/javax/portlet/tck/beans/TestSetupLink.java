/**
 * This bean encapsulates a single test result. When converted to a string or 
 * written to a writer, it generates HTML markup containing elements and IDs
 * that can be read by the TCK test driver. 
 * 
 * The TCK test driver works by accessing the page containing the test portlet,
 * clicking a link for the test if one is present, and reading the test output.
 * 
 * The test case is identified by a unique name string that contains no blanks. 
 * The test case name is used to generate ID's for the HTML result elements.
 * The following IDs are generated by this bean:
 * 
 * (TestCaseName)-success     - indicates general test case success or failure
 * (TestCaseName)-detail      - a detailed message about the test
