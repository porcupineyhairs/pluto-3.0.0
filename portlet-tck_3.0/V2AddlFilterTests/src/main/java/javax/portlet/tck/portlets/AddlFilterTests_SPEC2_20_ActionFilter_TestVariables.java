/**
 * This portlet implements several test cases for the JSR 362 TCK. The test case names are defined
 * in the /src/main/resources/xml-resources/additionalTCs.xml file. The build process will integrate
 * the test case names defined in the additionalTCs.xml file into the complete list of test case
 * names for execution by the driver.
 *
 * This is the main portlet for the test cases. If the test cases call for events, this portlet will
 * initiate the events, but not process them. The processing is done in the companion portlet
